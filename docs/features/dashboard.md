# Dashboard

The AI Analyzer Dashboard is your mission control for AI operations. It provides at-a-glance visibility into everything your agents are doing, updated in real time via Livewire.

## What You'll See

When you open `/ai-analyzer`, the dashboard presents a comprehensive overview:

### Stats Cards

Four key metrics displayed as stat cards with period selection:

| Stat | Description |
|:---|:---|
| **Conversations** | Total conversation threads in the selected period |
| **Messages** | Total messages exchanged across all conversations |
| **Input Tokens** | Cumulative prompt tokens consumed |
| **Output Tokens** | Cumulative completion tokens generated |

### Time Period Selector

Switch between periods to analyze trends:

- **Today** — Current day's activity
- **Last 7 Days** — Rolling week view
- **Last 30 Days** — Rolling month view
- **This Month** — Calendar month (from the 1st)
- **All Time** — Complete historical data

### Agent Breakdown

A detailed table showing activity per agent class:

| Column | Description |
|:---|:---|
| Agent | Fully qualified class name |
| Messages | Count of messages sent/received |
| Model | Primary model used |
| Input Tokens | Prompt tokens for this agent |
| Output Tokens | Completion tokens for this agent |
| Total | Combined token count |
| Cost | Estimated cost using the Pricing Matrix |

Token values are displayed as raw counts for precision — no M/K masking.

This helps you identify which agents are consuming the most tokens and which models they're using.

### Provider Count

The dashboard also tracks how many distinct AI providers are active, giving you visibility into provider diversification.

### Quick Navigation Cards

Below the stats, you'll find link cards for jumping to related sections:

- **Usage** — Full analytics and cost breakdowns
- **Pricing** — Edit per-model pricing rules
- **Alerts** — Budget threshold configuration
- **Health** — Provider reliability monitoring
- **Prompts** — Saved prompt library

## How It Works

The dashboard is powered by the `TodayStats` Livewire component, which queries the Laravel AI SDK's tables:

- **`agent_conversations`** — Conversation metadata
- **`agent_conversation_messages`** — Individual messages with usage data

AI Analyzer safely checks for table and column existence before querying, so the dashboard degrades gracefully if the SDK migrations haven't been run yet.

### Token Aggregation

Token counts are extracted from the `usage` JSON column on messages:

```json
{
  "prompt_tokens": 156,
  "completion_tokens": 89,
  "total_tokens": 245
}
```

AI Analyzer uses `JSON_EXTRACT` for efficient aggregation at the database level.

### Agent Detection

The agent column on messages is used to group activity. If your agents don't populate this field, the breakdown table will show limited data. Ensure your agents set the `agent` attribute on conversation messages.

## Use Cases

### Daily Standup Check
Check the "Today" view each morning to see overnight agent activity, conversation volume, and token burn rate.

### Cost Spike Investigation
Switch to "Last 7 Days" and sort the agent breakdown by total tokens to identify which agent caused a cost spike.

### Model Migration Tracking
After switching an agent to a new model, monitor the breakdown table to confirm the model change took effect and compare token efficiency.

### Capacity Planning
Use "All Time" view to understand long-term growth patterns and plan for scaling.

## Health Check

If you see a setup banner instead of stats, AI Analyzer's health check has detected missing tables. Run:

```bash
php artisan migrate
```

The health check verifies:
- `agent_conversations` table exists
- `agent_conversation_messages` table exists

## Customization

The dashboard view is a standard Blade template. You can override it by publishing views:

```bash
php artisan vendor:publish --tag=ai-analyzer-views
```

Then edit `resources/views/vendor/ai-analyzer/dashboard.blade.php`.

The Livewire component can also be extended — see [Extending AI Analyzer](/customization/extending-orbit).
