All notable changes to Laravel AI Analyzer are documented in this file.

## [1.0.0]

### Added
- **AI Run Observability** — AI Analyzer-owned run journal for Laravel AI SDK events via official SDK event listeners
- **Run Explorer** — Livewire component with search, sort, operation/status/provider filters, and pagination for one-off SDK calls
- **Run Detail View** — Inspect individual run metadata, tokens, cost, latency, and captured text payloads
- **Latency Percentiles** — P50, P95, P99 latency metrics in Provider Health
- **Dashboard Link Cards** — Quick navigation from dashboard to Usage, Pricing, Alerts, Health, and Prompts
- **Cost Column** — Estimated cost shown in dashboard agent breakdown table
- **Raw Token Display** — Token counts shown as raw values instead of M/K masked formats

- **HTML & Plain-Text Budget Emails** — Polished email templates for budget exceeded notifications

### Changed
- **Unified Usage Page** — `/usage` now combines today's stats and full analytics
- **Merged Analytics** — TokenAggregator, CostCalculator, and Provider Health now merge data from both SDK conversations and `analyzer_ai_runs`
- **Provider Health Data Source** — Always merges from `analyzer_ai_runs` and `agent_conversation_messages` instead of either-or gating
- **Period Selector** — Added visible date range indicator ("Showing data since...") in Provider Health
- **Chart Palette** — 15 distinct non-brand colors for better visual differentiation
- **Navigation** — Renamed Analytics → Usage, restored Prompt Lab in sidebar

### Fixed
- **CostCalculator Property Names** — Corrected `total_input_tokens` → `input_tokens` for accurate cost calculations
- **Provider Health Period Filter** — Period selector now correctly filters both conversation and run data
- **Usage Index Grid** — Enforced 3-column grid layout on usage dashboard
